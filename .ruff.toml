# Alternative Ruff configuration file
# This file takes precedence over pyproject.toml [tool.ruff] section
# You can delete this file if you prefer to keep config in pyproject.toml

# Symlink to pyproject.toml configuration
# (Ruff will automatically read from pyproject.toml if this file doesn't exist)
