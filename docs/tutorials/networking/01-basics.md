# Networking Fundamentals for DevOps

## Introduction
Understanding networking is crucial for troubleshooting connectivity and designing scalable systems.

## Essential Concepts

### IP Addressing and Subnetting
- **IPv4 vs IPv6**: Basic structure.
- **CIDR Notation**: Understanding subnets (e.g., `/24`).

### The OSI Model
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network (IP)
4. Transport (TCP/UDP)
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application (HTTP, DNS)

### DNS Resolution
How domain names are translated to IP addresses.
- `A` records, `CNAME`, `MX`.

### Diagnostic Tools
- `ping`: Check reachability.
- `traceroute`: Trace path to host.
- `netstat`/`ss`: Network statistics.
- `nc` (netcat): Network utility for reading/writing.
