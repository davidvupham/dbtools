# Exercises — 01_series_dataframe: Series + DataFrame fundamentals

## Goal
Build intuition for Series vs DataFrame and for label alignment.

## Exercises

1. **Series basics**
   - Create a `Series` of 3 numbers with a custom string index (e.g., `['a','b','c']`) and a `name`.
   - Print the Series, its `index`, and its `dtype`.

2. **Alignment behavior**
   - Create two Series with overlapping but not identical indices.
   - Add them together and explain (in 1–2 sentences) why some results are `NaN`.

3. **DataFrame basics**
   - Create a DataFrame with at least 3 columns of mixed types.
   - Select a single column (Series) vs multiple columns (DataFrame) and show the types.

4. **Vectorization vs loops**
   - Create a DataFrame with `quantity` and `price` and compute `revenue` using vectorized multiplication.

## Deliverable
Paste your code and outputs.
