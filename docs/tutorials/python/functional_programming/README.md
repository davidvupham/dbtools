# Functional Programming in Python

Welcome to the **Functional Programming in Python** tutorial!

This course is designed to take you from the basics of functional programming concepts to advanced techniques and best practices, all within the context of the Python programming language.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:

- The core concepts of functional programming (Pure functions, Immutability, First-class functions).
- How to use Python's built-in functional tools (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `lambda`).
- How to work with immutable data structures.
- Advanced techniques like laziness, partial application, and recursion.
- How functional programming aids in writing parallel code.
- Best practices and pitfalls to avoid when writing functional code in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python syntax (variables, loops, functions).
- Python 3.6+ installed.
