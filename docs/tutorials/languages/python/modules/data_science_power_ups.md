# 9 Python Libraries That Make You Look Like a Data Scientist

These libraries can significantly enhance your data science workflow, offering automation, visualization, and specialized capabilities.

## 1. Sweetviz
**Category**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Sweetviz is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with just two lines of code. It provides detailed reports on dataset distributions, correlations, and comparisons.

## 2. Rich
**Category**: Terminal Formatting

Rich is a Python library for writing rich text (with color and style) to the terminal. It provides beautiful formatting for tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source code, and tracebacks, making your command-line tools look professional.

## 3. Lux
**Category**: Visualization

Lux is a Python library that facilitates fast and easy data exploration by automating the visualization and data analysis process. It automatically recommends visualizations based on your DataFrames, helping you discover trends and patterns without writing complex plotting code.

## 4. Dython
**Category**: Data Analysis

Dython is a set of data analysis tools for Python. It is particularly known for its nominal correlation capabilities (using Theil's U and Cramer's V), allowing you to compute correlations between categorical and numerical features effortlessly.

## 5. Featuretools
**Category**: Feature Engineering

Featuretools is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It excels at transforming temporal and relational datasets into feature matrices for machine learning, saving significant time in the data preparation phase.

## 6. PyOD
**Category**: Anomaly Detection

PyOD (Python Outlier Detection) is a comprehensive, scalable toolkit for detecting outlying objects in multivariate data. It features more than 30 detection algorithms, including emerging deep learning models, making it a go-to for anomaly detection tasks.

## 7. TextAttack
**Category**: NLP & Adversarial AI

TextAttack is a Python framework for adversarial attacks, data augmentation, and model training in NLP. It allows researchers and developers to test the robustness of their NLP models by generating adversarial examples.

## 8. Streamlit
**Category**: Web Apps / Dashboarding

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. It is purely Python-based, requiring no front-end experience, making it perfect for data scientists who want to showcase their models and visualizations interactively.

## 9. Watchfiles
**Category**: Utilities / Automation

Watchfiles provides simple, efficient file watching and code reload for Python. While not strictly a data science tool, it is incredibly useful for automating workflows and triggering actions when data files or scripts change.
