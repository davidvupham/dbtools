# DevOps Job Preparation

## Strategies

### Resume Optimization
- **Quantify Achievements**: "Reduced deployment time by 40% using CI/CD" instead of "Created CI/CD pipelines".
- **Keywords**: Ensure tools in the job description match your resume (if you know them).

### Portfolio
- **Clean Code**: Your GitHub should be readable.
- **Documentation**: Every project needs a README explaining what it is and how to run it.

### Interview Prep
- **Scenario questions**: "How would you handle a production outage?"
- **System Design**: "Design a highly available web application on AWS."
- **Soft Skills**: Communication is key in DevOps.
