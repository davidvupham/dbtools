# System Design Learning Path

This directory contains resources for learning System Design, organized into core concepts and practical design examples.

## 📚 Concepts (The "What")

*Foundational knowledge required to understand distributed systems. Focus is on Tradeoffs.*

- **[Data Patterns](concepts/data_patterns.md)**: CAP, Sharding, Caching, Event Sourcing, CQRS.
- **[Messaging & Async](concepts/messaging_patterns.md)**: Queues, Kafka, Saga Pattern.
- **[Scalability & Reliability](concepts/scalability_reliability.md)**: Load Balancers, Rate Limiting, Circuit Breakers, CDNs.
- **[Communication & API](concepts/communication_patterns.md)**: gRPC, WebSockets, API Gateway, Service Mesh.
- **[Observability](concepts/observability.md)**: Distributed Tracing.

## 🧠 Staff-Level Deep Dives

*Advanced topics for senior/staff engineers.*

- **[Distributed Algorithms](concepts/distributed_algorithms.md)**: Time, Consensus (Raft/Paxos), Failure Detection.
- **[Database Internals](concepts/database_internals.md)**: LSM vs B-Trees, WAL, MVCC, Concurrency Control.
- **[Operational Excellence](concepts/operational_excellence.md)**: SLOs, Chaos Engineering, Capacity Planning.
