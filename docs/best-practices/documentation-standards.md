## Information Architecture

We follow the **[Diátaxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/)** to organize our documentation. Every document must fall into one of these four categories:

| Type | Purpose | User Goal | Folder Path |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tutorials** | Learning-oriented lessons. | "I want to learn..." | `docs/tutorials/` |
| **How-To Guides** | Task-oriented recipes. | "I want to do..." | `docs/how-to/` |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented facts. | "I want to know..." | `docs/reference/` |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented context. | "I want to understand..." | `docs/explanation/` |

## Directory Structure

Keep the document near the code it describes where possible, but mapped to the central `docs/` folder for discovery.

* **Top Level**: Always use the 4 Diátaxis folders.
* **Sub-directories**: Organize by *Topic* or *Product* (e.g., `docs/how-to/podman/`, `docs/reference/liquibase/`).
* **Architecture Decision Records**: Store ADRs in `docs/decisions/` with format `NNNN-title.md`.
* **Templates**: Reusable templates live in `docs/templates/`.
* **Archive**: Obsolete docs move to `docs/_archive/` (not deleted).
* **Images**: Store images relative to the document in an `assets/` or `images/` subfolder, or a central `docs/assets/` if shared.

## File Standards

### Naming Conventions

* **Files and Directories**: use `kebab-case` (lowercase with hyphens).
  * ✅ `install-guide.md`
  * ❌ `InstallGuide.md`, `install_guide.md`
* **Images**: `kebab-case` with descriptive names.
  * ✅ `architecture-diagram-v1.png`
  * ❌ `screenshot1.png`

### Standard Header

Every documentation file **MUST** start with the following H1 and metadata block:

```markdown
# [Clear, Descriptive Title]

**🔗 [← Back to [Topic] Index](./README.md)**

> **Document Version:** [Major].[Minor]
> **Last Updated:** [Month] [Day], [Year]
> **Maintainers:** [Team Name]
> **Status:** [Draft | Production | Deprecated]

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Production-green)
![Topic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-[MyTopic]-blue)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Related Docs:** [Link 1](./link1.md) | [Link 2](./link2.md)
```

### Templates

Use the templates in `docs/templates/` to start new documents:

| Template | Use Case |
|:---|:---|
| `tutorial-template.md` | Learning-oriented lessons |
| `how-to-template.md` | Task-oriented recipes |
| `reference-template.md` | API or configuration reference |
| `explanation-template.md` | Conceptual background |
| `adr-template.md` | Architecture Decision Records |

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone

* **Second Person**: Address the user as "you". Avoid "we" unless referring to the engineering team specifically.
  * ✅ "You configure the server by..."
  * ❌ "We configure the server by..."
* **Active Voice**: Make it clear who is acting.
  * ✅ "The system generates a log."
  * ❌ "A log is generated by the system."
* **Present Tense**: Describe how things work *now*.
  * ✅ "This command deletes the file."
  * ❌ "This command will delete the file."
* **Friendly but Professional**: Avoid slang, idioms, or overly casual language. Be concise.

### Grammar and Mechanics

* **Capitalization**: Use **Sentence case** for all headings (H1-H6).
  * ✅ `## Configure the database connection`
  * ❌ `## Configure The Database Connection`
* **Lists**:
  * Use **Numbered Lists (1., 2.)** for sequential steps.
  * Use **Bulleted Lists (-)** for unordered items.
* **Date Format**: Use `Month Day, Year` (e.g., January 13, 2026) to avoid international confusion.

### Internationalization

* **Language**: Use US English spelling (e.g., "color" not "colour").
* **Avoid Idioms**: Don't use culturally-specific phrases or colloquialisms.
* **Code Dates**: Use ISO 8601 format in code examples: `2026-01-22`.
* **Units**: Prefer metric with imperial in parentheses where relevant.
* **Define Acronyms**: Spell out on first use: "Application Programming Interface (API)".

## Accessibility

Ensure documentation is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

### Alt text for images

* **Required**: All meaningful images must have descriptive alt text.
* **Length**: Keep alt text under 125 characters (screen readers may truncate longer text).
* **Don't Start With**: "Image of", "Picture of", "Screenshot of" — the format is implied.
* **Decorative Images**: Use empty alt for purely decorative images: `![](decorative.png)`

Examples:
* ✅ `![Database connection flow showing client, pooler, and server](./assets/db-flow.png)`
* ✅ `![Architecture diagram: requests flow from load balancer to API pods to database](./assets/arch.png)`
* ❌ `![Image of diagram](./assets/diagram.png)`
* ❌ `![screenshot](./assets/screen1.png)`

### Charts and diagrams

For complex visuals, include:
* **Chart type** (line graph, bar chart, flowchart)
* **Data being displayed**
* **Key insight or trend**

Example: `![Bar chart comparing response times: PostgreSQL (45ms) outperforms MySQL (62ms) and SQLite (89ms)](./assets/db-benchmark.png)`

### General accessibility

* **Plain Language**: Use short sentences and simple words. Define technical terms on first use.
* **No Sensory-Only Instructions**: Reference labels, not colors or positions.
  * ✅ "Click **Submit** to save your changes."
  * ❌ "Click the blue button on the right."
* **Heading Hierarchy**: Screen readers use headings for navigation — don't skip levels.
* **Link Text**: Use descriptive link text, not "click here".
  * ✅ `See the [installation guide](./install.md) for setup instructions.`
  * ❌ `For setup instructions, [click here](./install.md).`

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headings

* Use ATX-style headers (`#`).
* Only one H1 (`#`) per page.
* Don't skip levels (e.g., don't go from H2 to H4).

### Code Blocks

* Always specify the language for syntax highlighting.
* Use `text` or `bash` for generic output.

````markdown
```bash
echo "Hello World"
```
````

### Admonitions (Alerts)

Use GitHub-flavored markdown alerts for emphasis:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

| Alert | Use When |
|:---|:---|
| NOTE | Supplementary information that adds context |
| TIP | Optional suggestions to improve workflow |
| IMPORTANT | Critical information for success |
| WARNING | Potential for data loss, security issues, or breaking changes |
| CAUTION | Irreversible actions or significant consequences |

### Navigation

* **Breadcrumbs**: Include a "Back to Index" link at the top of the file.
* **Footer**: Include a `[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)` link at the end of every major section.
* **Table of Contents**: Required for any document longer than one screen page.

## Docs-as-Code Practices

Treat documentation with the same rigor as code. This approach is used by Google, Microsoft, Spotify, and other industry leaders.

### Core principles

* **Same PR**: Update documentation in the same pull request as code changes. This keeps docs synchronized and provides context for reviewers.
* **Version Control**: All documentation lives in Git alongside the code it describes.
* **Review Process**: Documentation changes require review just like code changes.

### CI/CD integration

* **Link Checking**: Automated validation of internal and external links.
* **Spell Checking**: Run spell check in CI (configure project dictionary for technical terms).
* **Linting**: Use markdownlint or similar to enforce formatting consistency.
* **Build Validation**: Ensure docs build successfully before merge.

### Workflow

```text
1. Create branch for feature/fix
2. Write/update code
3. Write/update documentation in same branch
4. Submit PR with both code and docs
5. CI validates docs (links, spelling, linting)
6. Reviewer approves both code and docs
7. Merge deploys docs automatically
```

## Documentation Freshness

Stale documentation is worse than no documentation — it erodes trust and causes errors.

### Review cadence

| Doc Type | Review Frequency | Trigger |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **How-To Guides** | Quarterly | Related feature changes |
| **Tutorials** | Semi-annually | Major version releases |
| **Reference** | On code change | Every PR touching referenced code |
| **Explanation** | Annually | Architecture changes |
| **Quick Reference** | Quarterly | Command/API changes |

### Ownership

* **CODEOWNERS**: Add documentation paths to `CODEOWNERS` file for automatic review assignment.
* **Role-Based**: Assign ownership by role, not individual (e.g., "Product Team" not "Jane Doe").
* **Folder Owners**: Each `docs/` subdirectory should have a designated team.

### Staleness detection

* **Automated Alerts**: Flag docs not updated in >6 months for review.
* **Last Updated Field**: The `Last Updated` header field enables tracking.
* **Deprecation Flow**: Mark outdated docs with `Status: Deprecated` before archiving.

### Archival process

1. Mark document as `Status: Deprecated` with notice pointing to replacement.
2. Keep deprecated doc visible for 1 release cycle (or 3 months).
3. Move to `docs/_archive/` with original path preserved in filename.
4. Update any incoming links to point to replacement or archive notice.

## API Documentation

Standards for documenting REST APIs, particularly for FastAPI services.

### OpenAPI specification

* **Required**: All REST APIs must have an `openapi.yaml` or auto-generated spec in the service root.
* **Design-First**: Consider writing the OpenAPI spec before implementation for complex APIs.
* **Validation**: Use tools like Spectral to lint OpenAPI specs in CI.

### Required documentation elements

| Element | Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| **Endpoint Description** | Every endpoint must have a clear description of its purpose |
| **Parameters** | All path, query, and body parameters documented with types |
| **Request Examples** | At least one example request per endpoint |
| **Response Examples** | Examples for success and common error responses |
| **Error Responses** | All possible error codes with descriptions |
| **Authentication** | How to authenticate (headers, tokens, etc.) |

### Interactive documentation

* **FastAPI**: Use built-in `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` endpoints.
* **Code Snippets**: Provide examples in Python, cURL, and other relevant languages.
* **Try It**: Enable interactive testing where security permits.

### API changelog

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` for each API service with:
* Version number and release date
* Breaking changes (clearly marked)
* New endpoints and features
* Deprecated endpoints with migration path
* Bug fixes affecting API behavior

## AI-Readiness

Optimize documentation for AI-assisted discovery and retrieval systems.

### Structured content

* **Self-Contained Sections**: Each major section should be understandable without reading the entire document.
* **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same term for the same concept throughout all docs.
* **Explicit Context**: State prerequisites and assumptions at the start of each document.

### Metadata

* **Frontmatter**: Include relevant keywords and categories in document headers.
* **Semantic Headings**: Use descriptive headings that convey content (not clever titles).
  * ✅ `## Configure database connection pooling`
  * ❌ `## Getting connected`

### Modularity

* **Single Responsibility**: Each document should cover one topic thoroughly.
* **Cross-References**: Link to related documents rather than duplicating content.
* **Canonical Sources**: Maintain single sources of truth; reference them elsewhere.
