## Information Architecture

We follow the **[Diátaxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/)** to organize our documentation. Every document must fall into one of these four categories:

| Type | Purpose | User Goal | Folder Path |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tutorials** | Learning-oriented lessons. | "I want to learn..." | `docs/tutorials/` |
| **How-To Guides** | Task-oriented recipes. | "I want to do..." | `docs/how-to/` |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented facts. | "I want to know..." | `docs/reference/` |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented context. | "I want to understand..." | `docs/explanation/` |

## Directory Structure

Keep the document near the code it describes where possible, but mapped to the central `docs/` folder for discovery.

* **Top Level**: Always use the 4 Diátaxis folders.
* **Sub-directories**: Organize by *Topic* or *Product* (e.g., `docs/how-to/podman/`, `docs/reference/liquibase/`).
* **Images**: Store images relative to the document in an `assets/` or `images/` subfolder, or a central `docs/assets/` if shared.

## File Standards

### Naming Conventions

* **Files and Directories**: use `kebab-case` (lowercase with hyphens).
  * ✅ `install-guide.md`
  * ❌ `InstallGuide.md`, `install_guide.md`
* **Images**: `kebab-case` with descriptive names.
  * ✅ `architecture-diagram-v1.png`
  * ❌ `screenshot1.png`

### Standard Header

Every documentation file **MUST** start with the following H1 and metadata block:

```markdown
# [Clear, Descriptive Title]

**🔗 [← Back to [Topic] Index](./README.md)**

> **Document Version:** [Major].[Minor]
> **Last Updated:** [Month] [Day], [Year]
> **Maintainers:** [Team Name]
> **Status:** [Draft | Production | Deprecated]

![Topic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-[MyTopic]-blue)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Related Docs:** [Link 1](./link1.md) | [Link 2](./link2.md)
```

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone

* **Second Person**: Address the user as "you". Avoid "we" unless referring to the engineering team specifically.
  * ✅ "You configure the server by..."
  * ❌ "We configure the server by..."
* **Active Voice**: Make it clear who is acting.
  * ✅ "The system generates a log."
  * ❌ "A log is generated by the system."
* **Present Tense**: Describe how things work *now*.
  * ✅ "This command deletes the file."
  * ❌ "This command will delete the file."
* **Friendly but Professional**: Avoid slang, idioms, or overly casual language. Be concise.

### Grammar and Mechanics

* **Capitalization**: Use **Sentence case** for all headings (H1-H6).
  * ✅ `## Configure the database connection`
  * ❌ `## Configure The Database Connection`
* **Lists**:
  * Use **Numbered Lists (1., 2.)** for sequential steps.
  * Use **Bulleted Lists (-)** for unordered items.
* **Date Format**: Use `Month Day, Year` (e.g., January 13, 2026) to avoid international confusion.

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headings

* Use ATX-style headers (`#`).
* Only one H1 (`#`) per page.
* Don't skip levels (e.g., don't go from H2 to H4).

### Code Blocks

* Always specify the language for syntax highlighting.
* Use `text` or `bash` for generic output.

````markdown
```bash
echo "Hello World"
```
````

### Admonitions (Alerts)

Use GitHub-flavored markdown alerts for emphasis:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to success.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.
```

### Navigation

* **Breadcrumbs**: Include a "Back to Index" link at the top of the file.
* **Footer**: Include a `[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)` link at the end of every major section.
* **Table of Contents**: Required for any document longer than one screen page.

## Review Checklist

Before merging a documentation PR, verify:

- [ ] **Architecture**: Does it live in the right Diátaxis folder?
- [ ] **Descriptive Title**: Is the H1 clear and actionable?
- [ ] **Metadata**: Are Version, Date, Maintainer, and Status present?
- [ ] **Navigation**: Are "Back to Index" and TOC links working?
- [ ] **Formatting**: Are code blocks language-tagged? Are headers sentence-case?
- [ ] **Spelling/Grammar**: Run a spellchecker. Text should be active voice, present tense.
- [ ] **Assets**: Are images functional and accessible (alt text)?
