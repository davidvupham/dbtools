# Courses

Courses are comprehensive, learning-oriented curriculums designed to help you master a subject area (e.g., Python Engineering) through a structured path.

## Difference from Tutorials

While both are learning-oriented:

- **Tutorials**: Single-sitting lessons focused on a specific task or tool (e.g., "Getting Started with UV").
- **Courses**: Multi-module curriculums that combine theory, multiple tutorials, and hands-on projects to achieve mastery (e.g., "Zero to Hero in Python").
