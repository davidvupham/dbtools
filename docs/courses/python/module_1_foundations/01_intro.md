# Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level programming language** that emphasizes code readability. Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Python code looks almost like English, making it perfect for beginners.

## Why Python?

```python
# This is valid Python code!
if user_is_authenticated:
    print("Welcome back!")
```

Compare this to Java:

```java
// Same thing in Java
if (userIsAuthenticated) {
    System.out.println("Welcome back!");
}
```

Python is cleaner and easier to read!

## Your First Python Program

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores it
# Comments help explain what code does

# Print text to the screen
print("Hello, World!")

# Store data in a variable
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Key Concepts:**

- `#` starts a comment
- `print()` displays output
- Variables store data (no need to declare types!)
- `f"..."` creates formatted strings
