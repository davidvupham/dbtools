Test 1 Diagnostics - Minimal Container
=======================================
Date: 2025-11-14 13:09

ISSUE: Container builds and starts, but VS Code does not attach/return control

BUILD OUTPUT:
- Build completed successfully (5.2 seconds)
- Container started
- Container ID: 5148bdad8a89

CONTAINER STATUS:
- Status: Running
- Runtime: 3+ minutes
- Command: /bin/sh sleep loop (normal)

PROCESSES IN CONTAINER:
- PID 1: /bin/sh (init process)
- PID 238: sleep 1 (expected)

LABELS FOUND:
- devcontainer.config_file: /home/dpham/src/dbtools/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json ✓
- devcontainer.local_folder: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\dpham\src\dbtools ✓

UNEXPECTED FEATURES INSTALLED:
⚠️ CRITICAL: Container has features installed that are NOT in devcontainer.json:
- ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:2
- ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/git:1
- ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1
- ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1

ANALYSIS:
The container metadata shows features that are not specified in our minimal
devcontainer.json. This suggests:
1. VS Code is using a cached/different configuration
2. There may be multiple devcontainer.json files
3. The workspace file may override settings

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check for other devcontainer.json files in workspace
2. Clear VS Code dev container cache
3. Try with explicit --no-cache rebuild
4. Check workspace settings
