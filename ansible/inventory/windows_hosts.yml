# DEPRECATED: This file is kept for reference only
# Use the environment-specific inventory files instead:
#   - inventory/dev.yml
#   - inventory/tst.yml
#   - inventory/stg.yml
#   - inventory/prd.yml
#
# Global connection settings are now in:
#   - inventory/group_vars/all.yml
#
# Example usage:
#   ansible-playbook windows_service_account_rights.yml -i inventory/prd.yml -e "target_hosts=production"

# This was the original combined inventory structure with all environments
# Now split into separate files for better organization and security

    # Parent group containing all SQL Server hosts across all environments
    # You can target this with: hosts: sql_servers

# Notes on host groups:
# - 'all' is an implicit group that includes ALL hosts in the inventory
# - 'sql_servers' is a parent group containing development, staging, and production
# - You can target groups with:
#   * hosts: all                          # All hosts
#   * hosts: sql_servers                  # All SQL Servers (dev + staging + prod)
#   * hosts: production                   # Only production hosts
#   * hosts: development:staging          # Development AND staging hosts
#   * hosts: production:&sql_servers      # Production hosts that are also in sql_servers
