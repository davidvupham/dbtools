# Notes on host groups:
# - 'all' is an implicit group that includes ALL hosts in the inventory
# - 'sql_servers' is a parent group containing development, staging, and production
# - You can target groups with:
#   * hosts: all                          # All hosts
#   * hosts: sql_servers                  # All SQL Server hosts (dev + staging + prod)
#   * hosts: production                   # Only production hosts
#   * hosts: development:staging          # Development AND staging hosts
#   * hosts: production:&sql_servers      # Production hosts that are also in sql_servers
